            <p><b>Phnom Penh</b>, <del>Cambodia’s busy capital</del>, sits at the junction of the Mekong and Tonlé Sap rivers. It was a hub for both the
            Khmer Empire and French colonialists. On its walkable riverfront, lined with parks, restaurants and bars, are the ornate
            Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda and the National Museum, displaying artifacts from around the country. At the city’s heart
            is the massive, art deco Central Market.</p>

            <h3>2. History</h3>
            <p>
                <u>The initial settlement of Phnom Penh</u> is believed to have been established since the 5th century AD, according to the
                discovery of ancient kiln site in Choeung Ek commune of Dangkao district, southern part of central Phnom Penh in the
                early 2000s. Choeung Ek archaeological site was one of the largest kiln pottery center in Cambodia and the earliest
                known kiln sites in Southeast Asia to produce the ceremonial vessels known as kendi from 5th to 13th century.
                Archaeologist stated that a large community is surrounded by a circular earthwork structure that is 740 metres in
                diameter and 4 metres high, built in the 11th century. In addition, there are remnants of other ancient village
                infrastructure, irrigation system, inscription, Shiva linga as well as an ancient brick temple foundation and its ornate
                remains which dated back to Funan era.
